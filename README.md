### exhibition. The analog signal is sent via Serial.println() to a Raspberry Pi (B)running Raspbian
### Linux version 3.6.11+ (dc4@dc4-arm-01) (gcc version 4.7.2 20120731 (prerelease) ### (crosstool-NG linaro-1.13.1+bzr2458 - Linaro GCC 2012.08))
### A python script, ~/bst-fin.py provides the interactivity and plays the
### installation audio.
### _Requires PyGame and PySerial_
